KNN imputation method
- Impute the missing attribute values which are imputed by the attribute values that are most similar to the attribute whose values are missing.
- Similarity of two attributes is determined by using the distance functions. 


Hadoop
- Developed for processing large dataset for an application in a distributed computing environment
- Consists of the following components:
    - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
    - YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
    - MapReduce (Data procfessing using programming)
    - Spark (In-memory Data Processing)
    - PIG, HIVE (Data Processing Services using Query (SQL-Like)
    - HBase (NoSQL Database)
    - Mahout, Spark MLlib (Maching Learning)
    - Apache Drill (SQL on Hadoop)
    - Zookeeper (Managing Cluster)
    - Oozie (Job Scheduling)
    - Flume, Sqoop (Data Ingesting Services)
    - Solr & Lucene (Searching & Indexing)
    - Ambari (Provision, Monitor, and Maintain cluster)
    
    
Statistics
- Normal Distribution
    - Bell Curve or Gaussian Curve --> measure how much values can differ in their means and their standard deviations.
    - Data usually distributed around a central value without any vias to the left or right side
    - Random values are distributed in the form of a symmetricl bell-shaped curve

- A/B Testing
    - Statistical hypothesis testing for a randomized experiment with two variables A and B
    - Analytical method that estimates population parameters based on sample statistics
    - Test compares two web pages by showing two variants A and B, to a similar number of visitors, and the variant which gives better conversion rate wins
    
    - Sensitivity = (True Positives) / (Positives in Actual Dependent Variable)

- Null Hypothesis: Test for possible rejection under the assumption that result of chance would be true
- Alternative Hypothesis: Hypotheses contrary to the Null Hypothesis

- Univariate analysis: statistical technique that can be differentiated based on the count of variables involved at a given instance of time
- Bivariate analysis: Find the difference between two variables at a time
- Multivariate analysis: study of more than two variables

- Eigenvectors: used to understand linear transformations. Calculated for a correlation or a covariance matrix.
    - Directions along which a specific linear transformation acts either by flipping, compresisng or stretching.
    
- Eigenvalue: Strength of the transformation or the factor by which the compression occurs in the direction of eigenvectors.

- T-Tests: type of hypothesis tests by which you can compare means.
    - t = (mean - sample mean) / (standard deviation) / sqrt(sample size)
    - For 2-Sample Test, find out the ratio between the difference of the two samples to the null hypothesis
