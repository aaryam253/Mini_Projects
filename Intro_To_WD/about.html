        Sheeran's debut album, + (pronounced "plus"), was released in September
        2011 and topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained his first hit single
        "The A Team". In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male
        Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Sheeran's second studio album,
        × (pronounced "multiply"), was released in June 2014. It was named the
        second-best-selling album worldwide of 2015. In the same year, × won
        Album of the Year at the 2015 Brit Awards, and he received the Ivor
        Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of
        Songwriters, Composers and Authors. A single from ×, "Thinking Out
        Loud", earned him the 2016 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best
        Pop Solo Performance.
